## Development

```bash
npm install          # install dependencies
npm test             # run tests
npm run build        # build dist/
npm run test:coverage  # check coverage
```

## Guidelines

- Write tests for new features and bug fixes
- Keep changes focused — one feature or fix per PR
- Don't break existing tests
